        The Services make images originating from Source Partners (such as stock photography)
        available for you to view, license, purchase or otherwise access
        (&ldquo;<strong>Stock Images</strong>&rdquo;). In these Terms,
        the word &ldquo;Services&rdquo; does not include the
        &ldquo;Stock Images,&rdquo; but otherwise includes all other images,
        text, content, logos, and other materials included in or made available

        such as a thumbnail, watermarked image, low-resolution version,
        or other sample that is displayed to you through the Services
        (&ldquo;<strong>Preview Images</strong>&rdquo;) or (b) a version of a Preview Image
        that you obtain either from Dendrite through the Services or directly

        In these Terms, this separate license is referred to as
        a &ldquo;<strong>Use License</strong>.&rdquo; Licensed Images are often
        higher resolution, non-preview versions of a Preview Image, and more
        suitable for commercial or professional uses, but in some cases there
        may be no difference between the Licensed Image and the Preview Image.
      p.
        Unless otherwise indicated, the Services and Stock Images are
        the proprietary property of Dendrite or our licensors
        or users and are protected by U.S. and international copyright laws.
      p.

        to access and use the Services, and to view, download and
        use the Preview Images as they are made available for your
        viewing on the Website, solely for your internal noncommercial,
        research, or personal uses. However, such license is subject to
        these Terms and does not include (and you agree not to do) any of
        the following, except to the extent permitted under applicable fair
        use or fair dealing laws: (a) any resale of the Services or Preview Images;
        (b) the collection or use of any Stock Image listings, descriptions, prices,
        or related data; (c) the distribution, public performance or public display

        including any files or information contained therein; or
        (g) any use of the Services or Preview Images other than for
        their intended purposes. Any use of the Services or Preview Images
        other than as specifically authorized herein, without the prior
        written permission of Dendrite, is strictly prohibited and will
        terminate the license granted herein. Such unauthorized use may also
        violate applicable laws, including copyright and trademark laws and
        applicable communications regulations and statutes. This license is
        revocable at any time.

        at no charge. The terms of a Use License are made available to
        you while shopping for the Licensed Image, when purchasing
        the Use License, and/or through other means. By purchasing

        for a Licensed Image, you may not (a) distribute, modify, perform,
        display, sell, rent, or otherwise use a Licensed Image, or (b) transfer,

        or services through the Services. Your business dealings
        or correspondence with, or participation in promotions of,
        such third parties, and any terms, conditions, warranties
        or representations associated with such dealings or promotions

          PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT
          REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH DENDRITE AND
          LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM DENDRITE.
      p.
        You and Dendrite agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these
        Terms or your use of the Services or Stock Images, except that
        you and Dendrite are not required to arbitrate any dispute in
        which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged
        unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos,
        trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING
        IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Dendrite agree
        that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within
        thirty (30) days of when it arises. You and Dendrite further agree:
        (a) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration;
        (b) that any arbitration will occur in New York, New York;
        (c) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single
        arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (d) that
        the state or federal courts in New York, New York have exclusive
        jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over
        any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.
        The arbitrator will be entitled to award attorneys fees and
        other reasonable costs and expenses of arbitration to
        the prevailing party, and may allow discovery and other aspects
        of arbitration proceedings to be conducted by telephone or
        other cost effective means where practicable. Other than class
        procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has
        the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise
        be available in court. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION
        OR IN COURT, YOU AND DENDRITE WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER
        A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION
        OR PROCEEDING.
      p
        strong Modifications to the Services
      p.
        Dendrite reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily
        or permanently, the Services, or any features or portions thereof,
        without prior notice. You agree that Dendrite will not be liable
        for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services,
        or any part thereof.
      p
        strong Termination
      p.
        Dendrite reserves the right, without notice and in our sole discretion,
        to terminate your right to use the Services and to block or prevent your
        future access to and use of the Services.
      p
        strong Waiver; Severability
      p.
        Dendrite&rsquo;s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be
        deemed a waiver of the right to later enforce such provision or
        any other provision of these Terms. If any provision of these
        Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable,
        then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not
        affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
      p
        strong Third Party Beneficiaries
      p.
        You agree that each Source Partner is a third party beneficiary of these Terms
        solely to the extent necessary to enable such Source Partner to enforce
        the provisions in these Terms regarding your access and use of the Stock
        Images and related information and materials provided by such Source Partner
        through the Services. Except for the foregoing, there are no third party
        beneficiaries to these Terms.
      p
        strong Assignment
      p.
        You may not assign these Terms, including by operation of law,
        without the prior written consent of Dendrite, and your attempted
        assignment without such consent will be void and have no effect.
        Dendrite may assign these Terms to an affiliate or in connection
        with a merger, reorganization, reincorporation, or sale of the business
        or assets to which these Terms relate. Subject to the foregoing restriction
        on your assignment, these Terms will be binding on and inure to the benefit
        of you and Dendrite, and their respective successors and assigns.
      p
        strong Entire Agreement
      p.
        These Terms contain the entire agreement and understanding between Dendrite and
        you with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior
        agreements, negotiations, representations, and proposals, written and oral,
        relating to such subject matter. However, in addition to these Terms,
        you may have entered other agreements with Dendrite, and these Terms do not
        alter the terms of any such other agreement you may have with Dendrite.
